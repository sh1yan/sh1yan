### Hi there 👋 I am shiyan

I have been working hard to learn English recently, through Duolingo and Don’t memorize words. At the same time, I discovered an online practical shooting range for network security and fell deeply into it. I hope that I can become A red team player in the style of a sweeping monk, although my current job as a data analyst has basically nothing to do with penetration testing😄, I firmly believe that if I have direction and motivation, I will always succeed. 🌱
